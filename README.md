A library for parsing and manipulating CSS Level 4 Selectors. It tries to follow
the [specification for CSS Selectors](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/).

#Usage
##Installation 
This project is still in alpha and not yet available from NPM.

#Questions
##Why another parser for CSS Selectors?
I was in need for a working CSS Selector toolchain and available solutions were not
satisfactory. Since I had a course on compiler principles last term I though I
could write my own.
